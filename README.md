## Lab1 - Implementation of the algorithm "Regional search. 2-d tree method."
The application reads the input points and search region from the file and outputs the result to the console and to the output file. <br />

## Lab2 - Implementation of the algorithm "Triangulation Delaunay - randomized incremental algorithm."
The application reads input points from a file. It is possible to display each step of triangulation in a graphic window, and if desired, you can take screenshots of each step, which will be saved in separate files. <br />
The [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library was used to create the graphical interface. <br />
